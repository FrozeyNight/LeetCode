1. When you = an array or other non-primitive object e.g int[] ar1 = new int[1]; int[] ar2 = ar1; you give a reference to memeory, so if you do ar2[0] = 1; then ar1[0] will also be 1.

2. Don't use global variables unless you have to. It's bad practice and makes it so that method can't run async.

3. If you need to get the index of a value in an array multiple times, make a HashMap and map the array <value, indexInArray>, so instead of looking through the array multiple times, you simply look it up.

4. Lists are pretty slow and memory inefficient, so use them only if you have to.

5. Don't manualy implement functions that are already in the IDE. They might technically be faster, but will be way less readable and break easier.

6. When thinking about a solution, sketch it out. Don't spend half and hour just trying to imagine it in your head - it's much easier to spot issues or improvements when you have an actual visual example.
